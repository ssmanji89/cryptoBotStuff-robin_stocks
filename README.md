# cryptoBotStuff-robin_stocks
Set of Python scripts to 'tradeTheDips' on tradeable Crypto's and Accumulate Stock based on a Twitter Feed (on Robinhood). 

Just a set of tools I developed for personal use that seems to be useful - Post Betterments and Suggestions as Issues, please?

Note: Automation is only as useful as the Human at the Helm; take profits/cut losers often and #BTD/#STR.
